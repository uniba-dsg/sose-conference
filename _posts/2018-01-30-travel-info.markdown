On a workday, trains leave approximately every 10 mins and you need to take a train to Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof (main train station). There, you take any regional train to Bamberg.<br>Tickets for going to Bamberg can already be purchased at Nurembger airport. At the ticket machines provided by VAG or VGN you can get a ticket to Bamberg and need not buy another one at the main train station.
