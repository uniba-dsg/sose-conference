#### Bamberg Nightwalk Registration

As announced in the <a href="/blog/conference-program" >conference program</a>, there is a <strong>guided night walk</strong> through the historic center of Bamberg planned for Monday and Tuesday evening. For an ideal experience though, the individual groups must be limited in size, which is why you are kindly requested to <strong><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/tvgidqkea2hak7dn" target="_blank">register for either Monday or Tuesday</a></strong> evening.<br>
Furthermore, as everyone should be given the chance to join the tour, people arriving on Monday or participating in the Workshops on Monday are requested to register for Monday, so that people who arrive on Tuesday can still register for Tuesday.

Please fill in the <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/tvgidqkea2hak7dn" target="_blank">registration form</a> with your name and preference. Thank you!
