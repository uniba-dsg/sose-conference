#### Call for Papers (CFP) of IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering

To be held in Bamberg, Germany, March 26 – 29, 2018.

Starting from 2005, SOSE is one of the pioneering symposia devoted to the research in engineering service-oriented systems, from the architecture and computing paradigm to the development and management. Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) exploits services as the fundamental elements for developing computer-based systems. It has been applied to various areas and promotes fundamental changes to system architecture, especially changing the way software systems are being analyzed, architected, designed, implemented, tested, evaluated, delivered, consumed, maintained and evolved.

The innovations of SOC also offer many interesting avenues of research for scientific and industrial communities. Recent advances in service oriented computing and cloud computing, in particular with regard to microservices, the DevOps paradigm, and container-based virtualization, are providing exciting opportunities to make significant progress in understanding and solving complex real-world challenges. Such challenges typically require a system-level approach that models a complex system at different levels of abstraction, helps to develop sound architectures for addressing separate system requirements and concerns, and integrates diverse sources of knowledge on the system's components and their interactions.

Continuing the tradition of the last eleven SOSE Symposia, the 12th SOSE intends to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange latest observations, insights, achievements and visions in Service-Oriented System Engineering. Particularly, SOSE 2018 invites original submissions in all the areas of the system engineering and software engineering methods, techniques, tools, applications, and experiments for software services.

##### Journal Special Issues

Distinguished papers selected from the conferences and associated workshops, after further extensions, will be recommended for submission and publication in the prestigious journals or their Special Issues. 

##### Paper Submission Guidelines

All papers need to be submitted electronically using the EasyChair conference system with PDF format. The materials presented in the papers should not be published or under submission elsewhere. Each paper is limited to 10 pages including figures and references using IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscripts style (two columns, single-spaced, 10 fonts). You can confirm the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Author Guidelines at the following web page: [https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
