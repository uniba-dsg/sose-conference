#### Call for Papers (CFP) of IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering

To be held in Bamberg, Germany, March 26 – 29, 2018.

Starting from 2005, SOSE is one of the pioneering symposia devoted to the research in engineering service-oriented systems, from the architecture and computing paradigm to the development and management. Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) exploits services as the fundamental elements for developing computer-based systems. It has been applied to various areas and promotes fundamental changes to system architecture, especially changing the way software systems are being analyzed, architected, designed, implemented, tested, evaluated, delivered, consumed, maintained and evolved.

The innovations of SOC also offer many interesting avenues of research for scientific and industrial communities. Recent advances in service oriented computing and cloud computing, in particular with regard to microservices, the DevOps paradigm, and container-based virtualization, are providing exciting opportunities to make significant progress in understanding and solving complex real-world challenges. Such challenges typically require a system-level approach that models a complex system at different levels of abstraction, helps to develop sound architectures for addressing separate system requirements and concerns, and integrates diverse sources of knowledge on the system's components and their interactions.

Continuing the tradition of the last eleven SOSE Symposia, the 12th SOSE intends to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange latest observations, insights, achievements and visions in Service-Oriented System Engineering. Particularly, SOSE 2018 invites original submissions in all the areas of the system engineering and software engineering methods, techniques, tools, applications, and experiments for software services.

C. Survey and Emerging Subjects Tutorial Papers
In addition to regular research paper and industry practice/case study paper sessions, SOSE 2018 will also invite some tutorial papers, which review the state-of-the-art of the research on services engineering as well as the related emerging paradigms and technologies. These papers should summarize the recent research advance in service engineering from different perspectives, identify the open issues and future trends and challenges in the field. SOSE 2018 also encourages discussion papers which target at the visions on future related issues, including the emerging paradigms, technologies and applications. Papers should be no more than 10 pages in length.
