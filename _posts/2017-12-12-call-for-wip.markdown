#### Call for Work-in-Progress Papers of IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering

To be held in Bamberg, Germany, March 26 – 29, 2018.

We encourage researchers and practitioners to submit Work-in-Progress (WiP) as it provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work, and fostering discussions and collaborations in the fields of Service-Oriented System Engineering. 
SOSE 2018 invites original and unpublished on-going papers in all the areas of the system engineering and software engineering methods, techniques, tools, applications, and experiments for software services. 
All selected papers will be orally presented in conference sessions and published in the conference proceedings and will be submitted for inclusion to IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.

##### Paper Submission Guidelines

WiP papers should be no more than 6 pages in length, or at most 2 additional pages with the pages overlength charge, including figures, tables, and references.

WiP papers are expected to present early or ongoing research activities. Novel approaches and preliminary results are especially appreciated.

The submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by members of the Technical Program Committee. All selected papers will be orally presented in conference sessions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register and attend the conference to present the work. The accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by IEEE and will be included in the Digital Library in IEEE Xplore.

Authors are requested to submit original, unpublished manuscripts in standard IEEE proceedings format in PDF. All submissions must be typeset in double-column IEEE format using 10pt fonts on US letter paper, with all fonts embedded. Submitted papers must include the contact information of all the authors. Please make sure you use the latest version of the templates to prepare your submissions. Due to the short interval between the notification of acceptance and the camera-ready deadline, we strongly encourage authors to follow the camera-ready formatting guidelines as close as possible. You can confirm the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Author Guidelines at the following web page: https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html

Once accepted, the paper will be included in the conference proceedings and will be submitted for inclusion to IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.
