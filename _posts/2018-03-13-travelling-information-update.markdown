#### Travelling information update

Please be aware that there will be railway maintenance works on the route between Würzburg and Bamberg during the week of the conference. In case this affects you, for example because you arrive by plane at Frankfurt am Main, and you have already booked a train connection via Würzburg, be aware that there will be a bus (called SEV) operating from Würzburg instead of a train. You might consider changing your connection via Nuremberg.<br>
If you have not booked yet, the recommended route to Bamberg is via Nuremberg.<br>
