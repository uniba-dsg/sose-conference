#### Call for Workshops of IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering

To be held in Bamberg, Germany, March 26 – 29, 2018.

For the 12th edition of the conference, we are looking for co-located workshops on emerging and complementary topics. 
Interested workshop organisers should send an informal proposal by e-mail to the IEEE SOSE 2018 Workshops Chair: [Joerg Lenhard](mailto:joerg.lenhard@kau.se)

The deadline for proposals is 16. October 2017. The proposals should consider the subsequent deadlines for camera-ready submission and registration (1 February 2018) and for the workshop days (26 – 29 March 2018).

__The proposals should be sent as PDF, outlining in about two pages:__

* Title, brief description, goals and challenges of the field - motivating elements, such as why and to whom the workshop is of interest
* Comparison to related events on similar topics so that community fragmentation can be avoided
* Names, affiliations and contact information of the organisers and technical programme committee members (at least ten from various institutions)

Workshop organisers are asked to prepare a call for papers and an attractive website as supplementary material to the proposal. Furthermore, any conference requirements (paper format, registration rules, deadlines) need to be adhered to.

__A list of possible workshop topics:__

* Service-oriented systems and software
* Design and engineering principles for services
* Development, testing and operations in cloud environments
* Techniques and tools around the lifecycle of publishing, discovery and composition of services
* Code generation and quality-aware service construction methods
* Service domains: embedded/cyber-physical systems, robotics, IoT, web applications and mashups
* Business processes, federation and cooperation models
* Integration aspects: clients and environments
* New development paradigms such as cloud-native applications and microservices
* Mobility, scalability, elasticity and resilience of services
* Actively managed global-scale services
